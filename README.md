# GitHub Webhook Tracker

Saves payloads from GitHub Webhooks to a `payload.json` file.


## Installation

1. Download the GitHub Webhook Tracker
2. Set `payload.json` to 777 permissions
3. Link your GitHub project to link to *webhook.php*


## Usage

Payloads are saved to *payload.json*, so you are now able to check that file
for any newly triggered events from GitHub. See the
[GitHub Webhooks API](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) for more
information on the format of the events.
